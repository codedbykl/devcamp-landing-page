# DevCamp Landing Page

This project was coded to practice the knowledge about HTML and CSS acquired at Foundations Course of The Odin Project,  focusing on create a layout with Flexbox.

It's a simple landing page with some sections, perfect to learn Flexbox.

> P.S. I just followed the page layout, all the styles and information I created.

## What skills was used

- Basic HTML
- Basic CSS
- Create a layout with Flexbox

## Next steps

I focused on Flexbox practice, so there are no hover effects or anything else interactive. And it's not a responsive page yet.

- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] Add more interactive
- [ ] Add dark mode (priority :sweat_smile:)
